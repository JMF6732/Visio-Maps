README

This repository is a collection of process maps that I have created in Visio. 

Some are redacted and I have removed layers from the document(s), including annotation and gap analysis, however, I hope the flows themselves demonstrate some of my capabilities.

The Landscape Photography process was created as part of an interview assessment. The team and I had a call, I was given the topic at the beginning of the call and had 30 minutes to ask questions. After the call, I had 24 hours to create a process map and procedure document for the topic based on the questions that I asked. The Landscape Photography process map is the result that I turned in for the process map part of the interview assessment.

Thank you for reading!
